# The quest for easy and _good_ documentation

I think a lot about documentation. I genuinely enjoy working with tools that
are well documented, and when I work on my own personal projects, I can't rest
easy if I feel like the documentation is lacking.

# Great examples
- docs.python.org
    - [math module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)
- en.cpperference.com:
    - [`std::vector`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector)

# Documentation School
- CSE 331: Software Design and Implementation

# Almost great examples
- [Clear, Functional C++ Documentation](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/clear-functional-c-documentation-with-sphinx-breathe-doxygen-cmake/)
- EnTT Wiki
    - [ECS CrashCourse](https://github.com/skypjack/entt/wiki/Crash-Course:-entity-component-system)

# Not so great examples
- Anything that uses Doxygen for their frontend
    - [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/api/index.html): some of the worst
      documentation I've encountered

    - [EnTT documentation reference](https://skypjack.github.io/entt/) - looks ugly and
      hard to navigate, but at least there's effort put into it

- "The code is the documentation"
    - [Matlab/Octave API for SOFA](https://github.com/sofacoustics/API_MO)
    - [nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann): technically has
      doxygen website, but good luck figuring out how to use the library from
      it. The best way to learn how to use the library is to look at
      [their examples](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann/tree/master/examples)
      which are unfortunaley also lacking in comments.
